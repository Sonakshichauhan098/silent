    "How do dictionaries store data\n",
    "-- Python dictionaries use a structure called a hash table behind the scenes. here's how it works :\n",
    "1. Hashing the key\n",
    "-> When you add a key to dictionary, Python use a Hash function to convert that key into unique number called hash code\n",

    "Use a list when:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to store a sequence of elements and maintain order.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to access elements via their position in the sequence.\n",

    "🔸 When to Use Dictionaries\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Use a dictionary when:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to store key-value pairs (mapping one thing to another).\n",
    "\n",
    "You need fast lookups using a unique key.\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
